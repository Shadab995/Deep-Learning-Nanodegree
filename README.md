# Deep-Learning-Nanodegree
This repository contains all projects which are graded by Udacity during my nanodegree and classroom assesments of DLND 

Framework is specific to PYTORCH only.

# Project 1
## Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns

Build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

# Project 2
## Dog-Breed Classifier

Design and train a convolutional neural network to analyze images of dogs and correctly identify their breeds. Use transfer learning and well-known architectures to improve this model—this is excellent preparation for more advanced applications.

# Project 3
## Generate TV scripts

Build a recurrent neural network on LSTM using pytorch to process text. Use it to generate new episodes of your favorite TV show, based on old scripts.

# Project 4
## Generate Faces

Build a pair of multi-layer neural networks and make them compete against each other in order to generate new, realistic faces. Try training them on a set of celebrity faces, and see what new faces the computer comes out with!

# Project 5
## Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model

Train and deploy your own PyTorch sentiment analysis model. You’ll build a model and create a gateway for accessing it from a website.
